# Protein-Aptamer-Docking
Aptamer structure prediction according to protein.

This is a project created by Jiaming Xu at Northeastern University, Francisco Hung's computational group on Dec 18th, 2021.

There are 3 steps to achieve the aptamer structure prediction.

1. Creating aptamer database
2. Finding the physical properties as the principle for protein docking.
3. Validation

This is an open source project to be finished at least 2 years.
